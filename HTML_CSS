      <li><b>January 1995</b> - In 1995 this hole in the ground is a working china clay pit that is nearing the end of its economic life. And the Eden Project is just a twinkle in Tim Smit's eye. Having restored the Lost Gardens of Heligan, he's now looking for an epic setting to showcase the world's most important plants and realises he is going to need a very, very large space…</li>

      <li><b>October 1996</b> - The very first designs of the Eden Project Biomes are drawn on a napkin over a drink in a pub. Architect firm Grimshaw gets behind the project and takes its concept of Waterloo International as a starting point. Over time the design evolves into giant bubbles, because bubbles can settle on any shaped surface, even irregular clay pits.</li>

      <li><b>October 1998</b> - It rains everyday during the first few months of construction, sending 43 million litres of water into the pit. We devise a special drainage system for the pit, which sits 15 metres below the water table. The 230 miles of scaffolding used to build the Biomes earn Eden an entry into the Guinness Book of Records. </li>

Twice as high as the Tower of London, this space will eventually become home to over 1,000 different rainforest plant species. Many plants are grown from seed in our nursery; others come from botanic gardens, research stations and supporters. </li>

      <p>"It was great fun staying here with the quirkiness of staying in a converted shipping container.Excellent value for money. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Great place to stay when visiting the Eden Project as you feel you are making a contribution to helping the planet.</p>

      <p>I think someone mentioned in another post that there was only one fridge available. Well there are.now 3 fridges so the staff obviously listen and act on feedback."</p>
